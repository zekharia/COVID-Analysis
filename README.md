Project Title
COVID-19 Data Analysis

Introduction
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 datasets to derive insights about the spread of the virus, vaccination rates, correlation with socio-economic indicators, and more. With an ever-growing need to understand the trends and patterns of the virus and its impact, this analysis provides a holistic view using multiple datasets.

Datasets
CountryProfile: Contains socio-economic indicators for different countries, including GDP per capita, human development index, and more.
DailyData: Provides a daily snapshot of COVID-19 metrics, including new cases, deaths, tests conducted, and more. It covers the entire span of the pandemic and allows for time series analysis.
VaccinationData: Offers a detailed perspective on the vaccination drive, with data about the number of vaccinations administered, people fully vaccinated, and more.

All datasets are sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

Technologies Used
SQL: The primary tool for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis. Multiple SQL techniques, including window functions, CTEs, and joins, were employed to derive insights.
Tableau: Used for creating intuitive and interactive visualizations to represent the data. This tool helped visually analyze trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

Queries
The analysis comprises various SQL queries ranging from basic data exploration to advanced insights. Specifically, the queries delve into:

Global insights on the spread and impact of the virus.
Country-level overviews identifying hardest-hit areas.
Detailed analyses of COVID-19 case fatality rates, infection rates, and more by country.
Correlations between socio-economic indicators like GDP per capita and the virus's spread or impact.
Time series and trends to monitor the pandemic's progress over time.
Advanced insights, such as the time span from a country's first COVID-19 case detection to its first vaccination.

Findings
The global trend of new COVID-19 cases and deaths displayed a rise in cases in the omicron wave that wasn't followed by a rise in deaths.
The vaccination drive insights showed that economically developed countries have the highest vaccination rates.
Small isolated countries manage to delay COVID-19 outbreaks, 2 such countries even managed to start the vaccination process before they have a first case.

Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard visualizes various analyses, including:

A global overview of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
Top 10 countries with the most cases and deaths.
Vaccination rates of different countries.
Percentage of COVID-19 Positive Tests by Country and Date.
The time span from a country's first COVID case to its first vaccination.
